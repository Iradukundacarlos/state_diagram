This project describes a state machine for controlling a four-way intersection traffic light system. The state machine cycles through four main states to manage North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) traffic flows. Each state represents a specific light configuration:

Red_NS_Green_EW: NS Red, EW Green.
Red_NS_Orange_EW: NS Red, EW Orange.
Green_NS_Red_EW: NS Green, EW Red.
Orange_NS_Red_EW: NS Orange, EW Red.
Transitions between these states are timed, simulating real-world traffic light behavior. The system loops through these states continuously, ensuring safe and orderly traffic movement. When the system is turned off, it resets to the starting state.

This state machine provides a foundation for traffic light control systems, adaptable for real-world applications with potential enhancements like adaptive timing and emergency overrides.
